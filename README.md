Clean Code Test

Using either C# or F# and a TDD approach, spent no more than two hours on your solution. There should be an emphasis on clean coding principles.

Requirements
Supermarket items are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we will use letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy N of them, and they will cost you Y pence.

For example, item A might cost 50 individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three As and theyâ€™ll cost you 130.

Example items

SKU	Unit Price	Special Price

A	    50	        3 for 130

B	  30	        2 for 45

C	  20	

D	  15	

The checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we will recognize the two Bs and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95). The pricing changes frequently, so pricing should be independent of the checkout.
